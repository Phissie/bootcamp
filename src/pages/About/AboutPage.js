      Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer based in West London. I am passionate about
      functional programming, learning new languages and improving my
      proficiency. My passion for technology led me to launch my tech career in
      2017 working long hours for a start-up in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK. Daily,
      I convinced clients that our software will solve issues they had often
      given up on. I decided to learn to code after my long-suffering developer
      colleagues encouraged me to learn. 95% of my conversations with them were
      asking them to explain how they had built such beautiful software and also
      asking them if they could build the things my prospective clients were
      asking for . I started learning After completing a part time five week
      course with Google Digital Garage that introduced me to programming. In
      January 2020, I became a full-time developer learning Full Stack web
      development, ReactJS, JavaScript and CSS. When I am not working on my
      personal projects, I can be found around London doing Yoga, attending tech
      Meetup groups and conferences like Ruby Hack Night London, Code Bar
      London, IBM Code London and tech conferences like Code Mesh.
